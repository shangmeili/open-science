# Open Science Desktop

**Local-first, model-agnostic AI research workbench for macOS, Windows & Linux.**

Formerly Open Science. An open-source desktop alternative to Claude Science and
similar AI-for-science workbenches — built with Tauri, MCP, agent skills, and
reproducible artifacts. It connects agents, notebooks, files, figures, reports,
runs, and review into one auditable desktop workflow.

## What it does

**Runs the whole research loop** — from a broad direction to a finished paper:
exploration, literature survey, hypothesis, experiment code, analysis, figures, and
write-up, in one continuous, auditable session.

- **Autonomous research agents** — the bundled `ai4s-agent` chains specialist skills
  end to end (explore → survey → experiment → write), and each stage drops a real,
  inspectable artifact into your workspace, not just a chat reply.
- **Everything traces back** — figures, tables, reports, notebooks, and run outputs
  link to the exact code, inputs, environment, model output, and conversation that
  produced them.
- **Local-first and yours** — sessions, data, provenance, notebooks, and run records
  live in local folders on your machine. Nothing leaves by default.
- **Model-agnostic runtime** — the UI talks through `packages/sdk` to a bundled,
  pinned OpenCode sidecar. Bring your own model; providers, skills, and MCP servers
  stay pluggable.
- **Reproducible by construction** — local, SSH/Slurm, Modal, and notebook-batch runs
  are captured as reproducible run records, not loose terminal scrollback.
- **Extensible** — agent skills, MCP servers and one-click science connectors,
  `/` commands, `!` shell mode, and a model-agnostic SDK.

## See it in action

**One prompt -> a complete, traceable analysis.** Simulate data, fit a model, save a
publication-grade figure, and write a report where every number traces to the code.

**Literature -> verifiable report.** Search papers, draft a manuscript rendered as a
PDF, and audit citations, unsourced numbers, and figure/code consistency.

## Current capabilities

**The research loop, as skills.** One meta-skill runs the full pipeline; each stage
is a self-contained skill that produces a real, gradeable artifact — runnable on any
model OpenCode supports:

| Skill | Role | Primary output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ai4s-agent` | Runs the four skills below, in order | The full research package |
| `research-explorer` | Turn a broad direction into concrete topics | `research_exploration.md`, `topic_matrix.md`, `literature_pre_survey.md` |
| `literature-survey` | Write a literature survey | 6–20 pp PDF, 60+ real citations, LaTeX source, taxonomy figures |
| `experiment-suite` | Build an experiment package | Design doc, runnable code, `results.json` with provenance, figures, report |
| `paper-writer` | Write a research paper | 8–14 pp PDF, 200+ citations, 4–8 figures, tables |
| `mindmap-render` | Render a mindmap | Image generated from a `topic_matrix.md` |
| `integrity-auditor` | Audit a paper's integrity | Image / numerical / logical findings, 4-level evidence grading, `audit_report.md` |

These upstream `ai4s-skills` patterns are registered as inactive adaptation
candidates; they do not ship as runtime capabilities. AI4HEOR's first-party
skills implement the admitted research workflow.

### Platform

| Area | Current state |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop shell | Tauri 2 + React + TypeScript + Vite, with macOS, Windows, and Linux desktop builds. |
| Runtime | Bundled OpenCode sidecar, auto-started by the app, isolated from the user's own OpenCode config/data. |
| Sessions | Multi-session chat/history, dated workspace folders, global history across workspaces, `/` commands, and `!` shell mode. |
| Files | Global and per-session file browsing, context menu actions, external open/reveal, copy path, and local preview server. |
| Notebooks | Real `.ipynb` files, Python and R notebook creation, local kernel execution, managed Jupyter environment via bundled `uv`, and an Open JupyterLab action. |
| Runs | Append-only run logs, global SQLite run index, search/facets/pagination, local/remote surfaces, output links, logs, and reproduce prompts. |
| Provenance | `.openscience/provenance.jsonl` tracks file versions and links produced artifacts back to the run or edit that created them. |
| Review | Traceability, statistics-integrity, domain-check, large-file, publication-figure, remote-compute, and Modal run skills are bundled as first-party skills. |
| Viewers | PDF, image, video, HTML, Markdown, code, CSV/TSV tables with charts, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, molecules, 3D meshes, genome tracks, FITS, DOS/DOSCAR, EIGENVAL bands, qcode, anomaly maps, and phase files. |
| Models | OpenCode provider catalog, OAuth/API-key provider flows, custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and local/provider-specific options supported by OpenCode. |
| Interface languages | English, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, and Korean. Portuguese (Brazil) and Arabic are registered but not selectable yet. |

## Skills and connectors

Only first-party core skills in `runtime/skills/core/` are bundled by default,
including the AI4HEOR human-authorized PubMed/ClinicalTrials.gov evidence
search, evidence synthesis, model-design, reference-case, uncertainty, advanced
value-of-information, budget-impact, validation, and reporting workflows. Third-party Skills and MCP
servers are governed by a packaged admission registry: discovery candidates are
inactive, and only a compatible, reviewed, cross-platform, hash-locked
`validated-adapter` may enter the app-managed runtime.

The seven `ai4s-research/ai4s-skills` entries are currently quarantined for
adaptation. Anthropic's source-available `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx`, and `xlsx` Skills
are rejected because their per-directory license prohibits copying, derivatives,
and redistribution; AI4HEOR does not fetch or bundle them.

One-click science MCP connectors currently include:

- Literature search: arXiv, PubMed, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, bioRxiv/medRxiv.
- Biomedical databases: PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, MyVariant/ClinVar.
- Materials Project.
- FRED economic data.
- Space weather.
- Open-Meteo weather and climate.
- USGS water data.

You can also add any local or remote MCP server from Settings. See
[`docs/CONNECT_YOUR_TOOLS.md`](./docs/CONNECT_YOUR_TOOLS.md).

[`Open Science Desktop vs OpenScience`](./docs/open-science-desktop-vs-openscience.md).

## Install

Download the latest installer from the
[Releases page](https://github.com/ai4s-research/open-science/releases/latest).

- **macOS**: `.dmg` / `.app`, Apple Silicon and Intel, macOS 13 Ventura or later.
- **Windows**: NSIS `.exe` and `.msi`, Windows 10/11 x64.
- **Linux**: `.deb` and `.rpm` on x86_64 Linux.

Builds are not code-signed or notarized yet.

**macOS**: if Gatekeeper says the app is damaged or from an unidentified developer,
install it into Applications and run:

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/AI4HEOR.app"
```

**Windows**: if SmartScreen appears, choose **More info -> Run anyway**.

**Linux**:

```bash
sudo apt install ./AI4HEOR_*.deb
# or
sudo rpm -i AI4HEOR-*.rpm
```

## Build from source

Prerequisites:

- Node.js >= 20
- pnpm 9
- Rust toolchain
- macOS, Windows, or Linux system dependencies required by Tauri

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai4s-research/open-science
cd open-science
pnpm install

# Fetch pinned sidecars and bundled skills. These are git-ignored.
bash scripts/dev/fetch-opencode.sh
bash scripts/dev/fetch-uv.sh
bash scripts/dev/fetch-skills.sh

# Run in development or build installers.
pnpm --filter @ai4s/desktop tauri dev
pnpm --filter @ai4s/desktop tauri build

# Linux packages (AppImage is intentionally unsupported).
pnpm --filter @ai4s/desktop tauri build --bundles deb,rpm
```

Useful checks:

```bash
python scripts/dev/test_sidecar_integrity.py -v
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
```

## Safety and privacy

- Workspace files, raw data, session history, provenance, notebooks, and run records
  stay local by default.
- Command execution, file deletion, dependency installation, and remote connections
  are human-approved flows in the desktop app.
- Provider credentials are written to app-private runtime config, not to the
  workspace, provenance, git, exports, or global OpenCode config.
- Settings includes a plain-language data-flow view explaining what can be sent to
  the selected model provider.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `apps/desktop/` | Tauri + React desktop app. |
| `packages/sdk/` | `OpenCodeClient`; keeps the UI from calling OpenCode directly. |
| `packages/shared/` | Shared domain types and chart palette. |
| `packages/ui/` | Shared UI package. |
| `runtime/skills/core/` | First-party scientific skills. |
| `runtime/skills/external/` | Build-fetched external skills. |
| `runtime/harness/` | Runtime harness knowledge and operator context. |
| `runtime/mcp/` | MCP runtime notes/configuration. |
| `examples/` | Built-in example workspaces. |
| `scripts/dev/` | Sidecar, `uv`, skill fetchers, and focused regression probes. |
| `docs/` | Product, technical, operator, connector, and research notes. |

## Status

The project is a working desktop MVP in active development. The most reliable current
implementation log is [`PROGRESS.md`](./PROGRESS.md). Product and architecture notes
live in [`docs/PRD.md`](./docs/PRD.md) and
[`docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`](./docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md), but those documents include
target design as well as historical status notes.

Near-term work is focused on executing the configured four-target hash-bound package
manifest and Windows first-start gate, signed/notarized releases, physical Linux
desktop-session verification, auto-update, richer connector hardening, and
continued reproducibility review. The AI4HEOR 0.1.18 x64 macOS DMG is locally built and
payload-verified, including all 177 deterministic HEOR tests against its packaged core.
The AI4HEOR 0.1.18 Linux `.deb` and `.rpm` are also payload-verified, including all 177
deterministic HEOR tests and 260 configured resources from each extracted package. The
`.deb` passes a clean Ubuntu 22.04 install and headless first-start check; the `.rpm`
passes the equivalent native check on Fedora 42. A real visual Linux desktop-session
acceptance remains outstanding.
